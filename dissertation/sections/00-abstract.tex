Visualising massive networks in a browser causes both developers and users numerous difficulties. Challenges are the high amount of bandwidth and  computational power required to render a massive network, along with the difficulty of getting useful information from the network after it is displayed. After completing background research into the field, a systematic review of existing software was conducted, and a network visualisation system was designed and implemented. Finally, the system was evaluated and successfully confirmed techniques to improve performance and network visualisability.
