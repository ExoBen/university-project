The purpose of this research is to identify different techniques that existing software uses to visualise extremely large networks in a browser, and then compare them and review which methods are the most successful. This is good because ??. I did it by doing ??. I found out ??. Conclusion.

This project is about researching and implementing some way for networks of hundreds of thousands of nodes and millions of edges to be viewed by a user in a browser. This involves challenges such as getting over the issues such as bandwidth, processing power and memory for machines running on a network, along with the difficulty of actually visualising the network after it is rendered.
