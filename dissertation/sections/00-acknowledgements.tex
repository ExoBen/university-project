I would like to thank my project supervisor, Helen Purchase, and my advisor of studies, Dimitris Pezaros, for supporting me academically throughout my final year. Additionally, I would also like to thank Rory MacKenzie and all of SAS for motivating and supporting the project. 

Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family for their continued care and support.
